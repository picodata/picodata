//! Transaction management
//!
//! For general information and examples, see
//! [Transaction control](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/atomic_index/#atomic-atomic-execution).
//!
//! Observe the following rules when working with transactions:
//!
//! ðŸ‘‰ **Rule #1**
//! The requests in a transaction must be sent to a server as a single block.
//! It is not enough to enclose them between begin and commit or rollback.
//! To ensure they are sent as a single block: put them in a function, or put them all on one line, or use a delimiter
//! so that multi-line requests are handled together.
//!
//! ðŸ‘‰ **Rule #2**
//! All database operations in a transaction should use the same storage engine.
//! It is not safe to access tuple sets that are defined with `{engine='vinyl'}` and also access tuple sets that are
//! defined with `{engine='memtx'}`, in the same transaction.
//!
//! ðŸ‘‰ **Rule #3**
//! Requests which cause changes to the data definition â€“ create, alter, drop, truncate â€“ are only allowed with
//! Tarantool version 2.1 or later. Data-definition requests which change an index or change a format, such as
//! `space_object:create_index()` and `space_object:format()`, are not allowed inside transactions except as the first
//! request.
//!
