## Unreleased

### Added
- `--script` cli argument to set a path to a lua script executed at startup
- `--http-listen` cli argument to set [http server](https://github.com/tarantool/http) host and port.
  If specified the server will be brought up on startup with these params.

## [22.11.0] - 2022-11-22

### Features

- Brand new algorithm of cluster management based on the _"governor"_
  concept — a centralized actor that maintains cluster topology and
  performs instances configuration.

- Instance states are now called _"grades"_. This new term more clearly
  denotes how an instance is currently perceived by other instances (eg.
  how they are configured in its regard) rather than what it assumes
  about itself.

- Built-in _sharding_ configuration based on the `vshard` library. Once
  a replicaset is up to the given replication factor, Picodata will
  automatically re-balance data across replicasets.

- Clusterwide schema and data _migrations_ are introduced.

- Instances can now be _expelled_ in order to shrink the cluster.

## Compatibility

- The current version is NOT compatible with `22.07.0`. It cannot be
  started with the old snapshots.

## [22.07.0] - 2022-07-08

### Basic functionality

- Command line interface for cluster deployment.
- Dynamic topology configuration, cluster scaling by launching more instances.
- Support for setting the replication factor for the whole cluster.
- Failure domains-aware replicasets composition.
- Two kinds of storages:
  - based on Raft consensus algorithm (clusterwide),
  - based on Tarantool master-master async replication.
- Graceful instance shutdown.
- Automatic Raft group management (voters provision, Raft leader failover).
- Dead instance rebootstrap without data loss.
- Automatic peers discovery during initial cluster configuration.
